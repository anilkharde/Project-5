Surface Characteristic Prediction Of Grinding Process

Problem Statement:-
To design a Regression model by analyzing the collected data set which can predict the surface roughness (Ra Value) of a randomly chosen work piece.
Dependent variable: Roughness(Ra)
Independent variables are 24

Key Points:
1. Accelerometers, voltage and current sensors were mounted to check vibration and power parameters.Data set was prepared by filtering the 
signals and features were created based on properties of signal.
2. Models were built and significant features were selected based its importance.
3. ANOVA was done to validate the significance of model and features.
4. Optimization was done and significant values of process parameters were suggested for minimum surface roughness.


The final model has 29 prediction terms.
𝑅^2value = 0.877  Adjusted 𝑅^2 = 0.8473
Residual Standard Error = 0.09413
Mean Square Error =  0.01362

Optimal value of process parameters:-
Wheel speed=40.2699 rpm
Work speed=296.959 rpm
feed rate=1.02722 mm/rev
